# Pygame Arcade

Welcome to the Pygame Arcade! 🐍🎮 This repository is a collection of experimental Pygame projects and game prototypes. Here, you'll find a variety of games and interactive applications, all created using the Pygame library.

## 👾 Projects

1. **Game of Life**

   - An implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton where cells evolve based on simple rules.
   - Controls:
     - `Space`: Pause and resume the animation.
     - `Backspace`: Clear the canvas, removing all active cells.
     - `Left-click with mouse`: Draw active cells. If the simulation is running, it will pause when you click on the canvas.

2. **2048** - WIP

   - A recreation of the popular sliding tile puzzle game 2048. Combine numbers to reach the 2048 tile.
   - Controls:
     - `Arrow keys`: Move the tiles in the desired direction.
     - `Space`: Restart the game after a round.
